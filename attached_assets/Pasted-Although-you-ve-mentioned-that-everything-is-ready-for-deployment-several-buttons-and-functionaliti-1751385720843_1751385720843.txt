Although you've mentioned that everything is ready for deployment, several buttons and functionalities still appear non-functional—they seem more like placeholders. For instance, in the first image, there's a "Strategy Builder" feature, but I don't fully understand what it's supposed to do, how it should function, or what the workflow is—especially since I’m not from a technical background.

Within that feature, there's no visible button to save the conditions after adding multiple rules. How is a user supposed to preserve their strategy setup?

In the second image, once conditions are added and I navigate to the "Test" tab to run the strategy, it throws an error instead of executing the test. Similarly, in the third, fourth, and fifth screenshots, even after filling in all the required details, the strategy still can't be saved or created.

And this is just one section of the platform. There are many other pages and features I don’t fully understand—including the logic, rules, expected outputs, or even whether they’re working properly.

So, how can we utilize AI to deeply analyze and interpret the purpose, functionality, rules, and behavior of each component in the app? More importantly, how can we validate whether these features are working as intended?

If you’d like, I can help map out a checklist or flowchart to aid in this validation process—or craft prompts you can feed to your AI tools to assist in reverse-engineering the logic. Just let me know how deep you want to go.


So the same question I asked to ChatGPT, so they provided below response.

✅ Full Feature Flow & Logic Design
Page: Strategy Builder
Scope: End-to-end functionality from Rule Creation → Testing → Saving → Listing
Goal: Define exact what, how, and why for Replit AI or developers to implement and validate it completely.

🔁 Functional Flow Breakdown
🧱 Section 1: Strategy Rule Builder (/strategy-builder → "Builder" tab)
Step	Action	Expected Result	Notes
1.1	User selects indicator (e.g. Open Interest)	A new condition row appears	Dropdowns include: OI, PCR, IV, Volume, RSI
1.2	User chooses comparison (>, <, =, etc.)	Dropdown updates logically	e.g. “Greater than”
1.3	User enters a value (e.g. 200)	Value appears in preview rule	Validated as number
1.4	User adds another condition (e.g. AND)	Second row appears + updated preview	Connective logic updated
1.5	⚠️ Missing: Save, Continue, or → Next button	User is confused	Needs clear call-to-action
1.6	✅ Suggest: Add “Save Strategy Draft” or “Next: Test” button	Saves frontend state or triggers modal	Important for UX flow

🧪 Section 2: Strategy Tester (/strategy-builder → "Test" tab)
Step	Action	Expected Result	Notes
2.1	User clicks “Test Strategy”	App calls backend to evaluate current rules	Backend must parse conditions
2.2	⚠️ Error: “Evaluation Failed” shown without detail	Should return structured error	e.g. “Rule X is missing value”
2.3	✅ Expected: Visual result table	Symbol + time + condition status + result	
2.4	Optional: Allow user to backtest with historic date range	Future enhancement	Leverages backtest DB

💾 Section 3: Strategy Saving (/strategy-builder → "My Strategies" tab)
Step	Action	Expected Result	Notes
3.1	Clicks “Create Strategy” → modal opens	Inputs: name, description, rules, alerts	Modal is functional
3.2	Adds rules & alerts	Shown in preview	Working visually
3.3	Clicks “Create Strategy”	Nothing happens ⚠️	Likely no request sent
3.4	✅ Fix: Button must send POST /api/strategies	Payload: JSON of name, rules[], alerts[]	
3.5	On success → modal closes, strategy listed	“Success ✅” toast shown	UI feedback required
3.6	✅ My Strategies page now shows saved strategy cards	With Edit, Delete, Status columns

🧠 AI-Based Validation Prompts (Copy for Replit AI)
Prompt 1: Fix Button Behavior

txt
Copy
Edit
Please fix the “Create Strategy” modal so that clicking the button sends a proper POST request to /api/strategies. The payload must include strategy name, description, all rule conditions, and alert config. On success, close the modal and show a success toast. Also refresh the list under My Strategies.
Prompt 2: Diagnose Evaluation Logic

txt
Copy
Edit
Why does the “Test Strategy” feature fail with “Evaluation Failed”? Please trace the button’s click handler, inspect what payload is sent, and how the backend evaluates rules. Show the logic, expected response format, and fix any missing code.
