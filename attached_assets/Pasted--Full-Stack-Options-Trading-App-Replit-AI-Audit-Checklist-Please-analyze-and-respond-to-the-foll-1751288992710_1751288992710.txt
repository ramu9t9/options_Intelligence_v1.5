‚úÖ Full-Stack Options Trading App ‚Äì Replit AI Audit Checklist

Please analyze and respond to the following questions to help me validate or improve my system design.

‚∏ª

üîß 1. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
	‚Ä¢	Can you generate a high-level system architecture diagram of the entire full-stack app?
	‚Ä¢	Is this architecture modular, scalable, and suitable for high traffic (like Sensibull)?
	‚Ä¢	What are the critical improvement areas in the current architecture?
	‚Ä¢	Suggest any missing layers (e.g., caching, message queues, service separation).

‚∏ª

üíª 2. FRONTEND (React or other)
	‚Ä¢	List the main React components and their responsibilities.
	‚Ä¢	Are we using an efficient state management solution (Redux, Zustand, Context API)?
	‚Ä¢	Are components reusable and optimized (useMemo/useCallback/lazy loading)?
	‚Ä¢	Is the frontend responsive and mobile-optimized?

‚∏ª

‚öôÔ∏è 3. BACKEND (Node.js / FastAPI / Express / etc.)
	‚Ä¢	List all backend routes and their purposes.
	‚Ä¢	Are the routes/controllers/services properly modularized?
	‚Ä¢	Is the backend built using RESTful standards? Any GraphQL support?
	‚Ä¢	How are data validations handled (e.g., Joi, Pydantic, Zod)?
	‚Ä¢	Are there any middlewares for authentication, logging, or error handling?

‚∏ª

üóÑÔ∏è 4. DATABASE DESIGN
	‚Ä¢	Provide the current database schema (tables/collections and fields).
	‚Ä¢	Which tables store:
	1.	Option chain data
	2.	Real-time data snapshots
	3.	User strategies
	4.	Alerts and notifications
	5.	Historical trades
	‚Ä¢	Are indexes added to optimize performance?
	‚Ä¢	Is data normalized or denormalized? Explain the rationale.

‚∏ª

üîå 5. API INTEGRATIONS (Angel One, Dhan, NSE, etc.)
	‚Ä¢	Explain the integration logic for each broker API (Angel One, Dhan, NSE fallback).
	‚Ä¢	Is token management handled securely (refresh, expiry)?
	‚Ä¢	Do we support failover in case the primary API is unavailable?
	‚Ä¢	Are API responses cached (e.g., Redis/in-memory/local file)?
	‚Ä¢	How are errors or disconnections from APIs handled?

‚∏ª

‚è±Ô∏è 6. REAL-TIME DATA MANAGEMENT
	‚Ä¢	How frequently is live data fetched and processed?
	‚Ä¢	Are we using polling, WebSockets, or server-sent events (SSE)?
	‚Ä¢	Where is real-time data stored temporarily or permanently?
	‚Ä¢	Is there a throttling or queue system to manage broker API rate limits?

‚∏ª

üß† 7. STRATEGY BUILDER / CUSTOM SCANNERS
	‚Ä¢	How can users define and save their own strategy/scanner rules?
	‚Ä¢	Where and how are these rules stored (DB structure)?
	‚Ä¢	Is the rule engine synchronous or asynchronous?
	‚Ä¢	Can strategies be backtested with historical data snapshots?

‚∏ª

üîê 8. AUTHENTICATION & ROLES
	‚Ä¢	What auth system is being used? (JWT, OAuth, Sessions, etc.)
	‚Ä¢	Are user roles implemented (guest, retail, admin)?
	‚Ä¢	Can guest users access limited features without logging in?
	‚Ä¢	How is role-based access enforced in routes/components?

‚∏ª

üì§ 9. NOTIFICATIONS & ALERTING
	‚Ä¢	How are user alerts defined, stored, and triggered?
	‚Ä¢	Do alerts support multiple channels (Email, Webhook, SMS)?
	‚Ä¢	How often are alert conditions evaluated (e.g., every 10s)?
	‚Ä¢	Is there a retry or queue system for failed alerts?

‚∏ª

üìÜ 10. BACKGROUND JOBS & TASK SCHEDULING
	‚Ä¢	Are we using cron jobs, Node schedulers, or Celery/RQ workers?
	‚Ä¢	How are snapshot jobs (EOD, 5s, 15min) scheduled and stored?
	‚Ä¢	Do long-running jobs run in background workers or main server?

‚∏ª

üìà 11. PERFORMANCE & SCALABILITY
	‚Ä¢	Are API responses or computed Greeks cached in memory or Redis?
	‚Ä¢	Is there load balancing or horizontal scaling potential?
	‚Ä¢	How is broker API rate limiting handled?
	‚Ä¢	What‚Äôs the database optimization strategy for large datasets?

‚∏ª

üß™ 12. TESTING, ERROR HANDLING, LOGGING
	‚Ä¢	Are there any automated tests (unit, integration, end-to-end)?
	‚Ä¢	How are backend and frontend errors logged and handled?
	‚Ä¢	Do we log external API failures or rate limit breaches?

‚∏ª

üöÄ 13. DEPLOYMENT & ENVIRONMENT
	‚Ä¢	Is the current setup suitable for production (or just Replit testing)?
	‚Ä¢	Can the full app be containerized? Please provide a sample Dockerfile.
	‚Ä¢	Are .env configs safely managed and injected?
	‚Ä¢	Suggest best practice for future deployment (Vercel, AWS, Fly.io, etc.).

‚∏ª

üìä 14. USER ANALYTICS & USAGE TRACKING
	‚Ä¢	Are we collecting analytics like most-used strategies or scan patterns?
	‚Ä¢	Can we track user behavior for product improvement?
	‚Ä¢	Where is user activity stored?

‚∏ª

ü§ñ 15. FUTURE AI INTEGRATION POTENTIAL
	‚Ä¢	Can we later integrate AI models to generate or recommend trading strategies?
	‚Ä¢	Suggest architecture changes to allow AI-driven insights (Phase 3+).
	‚Ä¢	Can we collect training data from user strategy usage logs?
