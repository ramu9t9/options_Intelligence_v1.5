# Full-Stack Options Intelligence Platform: System Design & Development Roadmap

## Introduction

The Options Intelligence Platform is a full-stack, real-time options analytics system designed for advanced pattern detection, market insights, and rich data visualization. It delivers live options market data and analysis to users without requiring individual data feed credentials, thanks to a centralized data feed architecture. This report presents a comprehensive system design and a phased development roadmap, integrating customization goals such as a **Custom Scanner Builder**, **multi-channel alerting (in-app, email, SMS, webhooks)**, and future **portfolio tracking dashboards**, while deferring features like a dedicated mobile app and white-label multi-tenancy until post-MVP phases. Key considerations in the design include modular architecture for scalability, secure handling of API credentials, and a clear evolution path from rule-based pattern detection to machine learning-driven insights.

## System Architecture Overview

The platform follows a modern web architecture with a React frontend and a Node.js/Express backend, backed by a MySQL database (with SQLite for development). Real-time updates are delivered via WebSocket (Socket.IO) for low-latency streaming. A centralized data feed service on the backend maintains a single admin connection to the **Angel One** API for market data, broadcasting updates to all clients. The design emphasizes security (no sensitive data exposed to clients), horizontal scalability via containerization, and a clear separation of concerns into modular services (data feed, pattern detection, alerts, etc.). Figure 1 illustrates the high-level architecture.

### Frontend (React & Visualization)

The frontend is implemented in **React 18+ with TypeScript**, providing a responsive trading dashboard accessible via web browsers. Key interface components include an interactive **Option Chain** table, real-time charts (OI trends, price movement, PCR, etc.), pattern indicators, and a market summary dashboard. The UI is designed to be responsive (desktop/mobile web) with a consistent dark/light theme. Because the web app is mobile-responsive, a dedicated React Native mobile app is **deferred post-MVP** (the roadmap lists a mobile application as a future enhancement). The frontend communicates with the backend via RESTful API calls for on-demand data and uses a persistent WebSocket connection for streaming real-time updates and alerts. This ensures users see live option data updates and instantaneous pattern signals without page refreshes.

### Backend (Node.js Express Services)

The backend is built on **Node.js 18+ with Express** and is structured into modular services. It exposes **REST API endpoints** for data retrieval and control operations, and a **WebSocket server** (using Socket.IO) to push real-time market data and notifications to clients. Major backend modules include:

* **Centralized Data Feed Service** – Maintains a single authenticated connection to Angel One’s streaming API (using admin API key and secrets) and aggregates real-time option chain data. It automatically falls back to alternative providers (like NSE or Yahoo Finance) in case of outages, ensuring high data availability. This service caches the latest market snapshots (e.g. in memory or Redis) for quick broadcast and stores periodic snapshots to the database. All provider credentials are stored securely (never sent to clients) – for example, encrypted in a server-side database table – to prevent leakage of keys.

* **Pattern Detection Service** – Continuously analyzes incoming option chain data to detect defined patterns. Initially this is a rule-based engine (implemented as part of the Node backend) that checks for conditions like large OI changes, price moves, volume spikes, etc., corresponding to patterns (see **Pattern Detection Logic** below). Detected patterns are assigned confidence scores and saved to the `market_signals` database table for auditing and client retrieval. The service supports multi-timeframe analysis (1min, 5min, 15min, etc.) to identify patterns at different granularities. As load grows, this component can be isolated as an independent microservice (or Node worker thread) to scale horizontally (e.g. multiple pattern detection workers processing different instruments in parallel).

* **Alerts & Notification Service** – Manages user-defined alerts and notification delivery. It listens for new signals or threshold triggers (e.g. a significant OI change) and dispatches alerts via multiple channels: in-app (WebSocket push), email, SMS, and webhooks to third-party URLs. In-app and email alerts are part of the core Phase 3 deliverable, and SMS/webhook channels are introduced in a later phase. The service integrates with external SMS/Email gateways (e.g. Twilio or AWS SES) and invokes user-configured webhook endpoints for instantaneous alerting. Users can configure their alert preferences and thresholds in the frontend, which the backend stores (linked to their profile/subscription) and uses to filter notifications. An **Alert Center** UI provides a history of alerts and allows acknowledgment or tuning of alert rules.

* **Backtesting Engine** – Introduced by Phase 4, this module allows historical data replay and strategy testing. It pulls historical option data (from the database or an external archive) and runs pattern detection logic on past data to evaluate strategy performance (e.g. how often a “Call Long Buildup” led to expected price moves). It computes metrics like win-rate, drawdown, and can simulate portfolio P/L impacts of following the signals. The roadmap notes that a backtesting engine architecture was planned with features like strategy performance metrics, risk analysis, and portfolio simulation. In the implemented system, backtesting results will be presented with detailed reports in the UI by the time of commercial launch.

* **Admin Module** – An internal module (with a corresponding **Admin Dashboard** frontend) for administrators to monitor system health and manage configurations. Admin capabilities include monitoring data feed status, provider connection health, user activity, and system performance metrics. Admins can manage data provider credentials (e.g. updating the Angel One API key), toggle providers, and view error logs. This module enforces Role-Based Access Control so that only Admin users (and not regular traders) can access these endpoints.

* **Subscription & RBAC Module** – Handles user authentication (if applicable for certain features) and enforces feature access based on subscription tier or role. While the platform’s core analytics can be accessed without login (per initial requirement), the commercial version introduces user accounts for subscription management. This module validates if a user’s plan allows access to certain features (e.g. free tier might see limited instruments or delayed data, Pro tier gets full real-time data, etc., as defined in the subscription plans table). It also implements rate limiting and API usage limits per plan. All passwords or tokens are stored securely (hashed), and JWTs or similar tokens are used for session management. In early phases, user management is minimal, but by Phase 2 we introduce basic subscription tier enforcement, and by Phase 3–4, robust RBAC is in place along with an optional user login flow for premium features.

The backend is stateless wherever possible (especially the REST API and WebSocket broadcast, which rely on external caching/db for state) to enable scaling. By using Docker containers and Kubernetes in production, we can run multiple backend instances behind a load balancer, achieving horizontal scalability. The **modular architecture** allows scaling specific services – for example, deploying extra instances of the data feed service or pattern detector for load, or separating them into distinct microservices – aligning with the documentation’s guidance on microservices and load balancing for high traffic.

### Data Storage and Security

A **MySQL 8.0+** database is the primary datastore, chosen for reliability and ACID compliance. The schema is normalized and indexed for fast queries. Core tables include:

* **instruments** (list of tradable instruments),
* **option\_data** (timestamped option chain snapshots),
* **market\_signals** (detected patterns/signals with metadata),
* **user\_profiles** and **user\_subscriptions** (if user accounts are enabled for commercial features), and
* **service\_providers** (credentials and configs for data provider APIs).

For development and testing, a lightweight **SQLite** database can be used as a fallback, simplifying setup on Replit or local machines. A caching layer (like **Redis**) is employed to store hot data (recent option chain and computed indicators) with short TTL, greatly reducing database load for frequently accessed queries. This provides near real-time performance even under heavy user load, as noted by the use of “Redis-style caching” in the commercial roadmap.

**Security practices** are applied throughout the stack. All API communication is over HTTPS and WebSocket Secure to protect data in transit. Sensitive information (such as the Angel One API key, client ID, and secret) is stored securely on the backend – either injected via environment variables in development, or stored encrypted in the database in production. For example, the `service_providers` table holds encrypted API credentials for providers, ensuring that even if the database is compromised the raw keys are not exposed. The centralized data service uses these credentials server-side, so end-users never handle or see the provider keys, mitigating abuse risk. Input validation and sanitization are enforced on all APIs to prevent injection attacks, and the system is hardened against common web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, SQL injection). The platform also implements **rate limiting** strategies to protect against DDoS or misuse – aligning with provider API limits and throttling excessive requests per user or IP. Prior to launch, a thorough security audit and penetration testing will be performed (scheduled in the roadmap).

### Scalability and Deployment

For rapid prototyping, the development stack can be hosted on **Replit**, allowing quick iterations on the React frontend and Node.js backend in a cloud IDE environment. In production, the deployment will be containerized with **Docker** and orchestrated via **Kubernetes** on a cloud provider (AWS or GCP). Kubernetes will manage scaling (multiple replicas of the Node backend, with stateless services scaled out as needed) and provide resiliency (automatic restarts, self-healing). A typical production setup will include a load balancer service (to route requests to Node pods), an auto-scaling group for the backend, and managed MySQL (or Aurora) and Redis services for reliability. CI/CD pipelines will be established by Phase 4 to automate testing, container builds, and deployments to staging/production clusters. Environment-specific configurations (like API keys, database URLs) will be handled via Kubernetes Secrets or cloud secret managers, **never hard-coded in code**, to adhere to best practices. Horizontal scaling is built into the design – for instance, the WebSocket server can scale to thousands of concurrent users by using sticky sessions or a pub/sub broker to distribute real-time messages across nodes. The target is to support **10,000+ concurrent users** with sub-second data latency, as outlined in the performance goals.

By using a modular microservice-friendly architecture, the platform can grow in functionality without degrading performance. New services (e.g. a dedicated machine learning service in future) can be added and scaled independently. The architecture is also **cloud-agnostic**; while AWS/GCP is targeted for production, the use of Docker/K8s means the system can be deployed on any cloud or on-premise with minimal changes. Logging and monitoring (using tools like Prometheus/Grafana or cloud monitoring services) will be set up to track system health, and automated backups will protect data.

## Pattern Detection Logic and Evolution

At the core of the platform is the **pattern detection engine**, which identifies unusual trading patterns from option chain data in real time. Initially, the system employs **rule-based algorithms** based on domain expertise in options trading. The provided documentation specifies thresholds and conditions for various patterns – for example, a large **Open Interest (OI) increase** combined with rising call option premium might trigger a **Call Long Buildup (bullish)** signal. Conversely, a sharp OI drop with price rise in calls could indicate **Call Short Covering**, and similar logic applies to put options (Put Long Buildup for bearish signals, Put Short Covering for bullish reversals). These four basic patterns (Call/Put Long Buildup, Call/Put Short Covering) form the Phase 2 feature set. The detection logic monitors changes between ticks: for each strike price, it looks at OI change, price change, and volume against configurable thresholds. For instance, the engine might use a threshold like *OI\_CHANGE\_THRESHOLD = 5000 contracts* or *Premium\_CHANGE\_THRESHOLD = 5%* to decide if a move is significant. If conditions are met, it creates a signal with a confidence score (e.g. high confidence if OI change >> threshold). Each signal includes metadata like underlying symbol, strike, pattern type, direction (bullish/bearish), and a timestamp, which the frontend can display with contextual explanations.

In **Phase 3**, the platform expands to **advanced patterns** beyond the basic four. This includes patterns like **Gamma Squeeze**, **Volatility Spikes**, **Max Pain level approach**, **Unusual Options Activity**, **Momentum Shifts**, and support/resistance based signals. These often require synthesizing multiple data points: e.g. *Gamma Squeeze* detection might analyze changes in OI across ITM/OTM strikes and underlying price movement to identify a feedback loop scenario; *Max Pain* calculation requires aggregating OI across all strikes to find the price point where option writers have minimal loss. The rule-based engine will be extended with specific logic for each new pattern. For example, a **Volatility Spike** alert might trigger if implied volatility or price swings exceed historical standard deviations, and an **Unusual Activity** might flag when OI or volume at a strike is 3x the average. Multi-timeframe analysis is also enhanced – the system concurrently evaluates patterns on 1-min, 5-min, 15-min, 1-hr and daily intervals, allowing a pattern (like momentum shift) to be confirmed across short and long-term charts. All detected patterns are visualized in the UI with clear indicators (e.g. color-coded labels on the option chain, or icons on charts) and accompanied by confidence scores and descriptions, so users can understand the insights at a glance.

**Machine Learning Overlay:** As data accumulates, the plan is to incorporate machine learning to improve and complement the rule-based detection (Phase 3+ and beyond). Initially, the system will log all pattern signals and the subsequent market outcomes – creating a labeled dataset of patterns that led to profitable moves vs false alarms. In a future **Phase 5**, a machine learning model (e.g. a gradient boosting classifier or a small Transformer-based model) can be trained on this data to predict the likelihood of a pattern leading to a significant price move. The documentation lists *“machine learning for pattern prediction”* as a future enhancement. In practice, the ML overlay might re-score the confidence of detected patterns or identify complex nonlinear patterns that are hard-coded rules miss. For example, an ML model could learn subtle combinations of OI changes across multiple strikes that precede a big move (a form of pattern the rule engine isn’t explicitly programmed for). Initially, we will use ML in a **hybrid approach** – the rule engine generates candidate signals, and an ML model (once available) can filter or prioritize them (Phase 3 or 4). By Phase 5, the system could also attempt fully automated pattern discovery using unsupervised learning on historical option data, though this is exploratory. All ML components will be introduced carefully, ensuring that sufficient historical data has been gathered and that any predictive model meets accuracy thresholds >90% before affecting user-facing alerts. Even as ML is adopted, user transparency remains key – we will continue to explain pattern signals (what triggered them) and allow users to create **custom rules** via the Custom Scanner feature, rather than treating the model as a “black box.”

## Development Roadmap

Development is organized into iterative phases, each spanning 2-week sprints (approximately), with a focus on incremental feature builds, testing, and feedback incorporation. The roadmap below aligns with the provided documentation’s phases, augmented with the new feature goals and deployment targets:

**Note:** Each phase above concludes with a review and hardening of the delivered features. By Phase 4, the product is ready for initial launch with core functionality. Phase 5 (the commercial launch sprint) focuses on premium feature roll-out and ensuring the platform’s robustness for a wider user base. Features deferred beyond Phase 4 (like mobile apps and white-labeling) are consciously scheduled later to keep the MVP scope manageable – this matches the documentation’s listing of mobile and multi-tenant support under *“Future Enhancements”*.

Throughout development, the team will integrate continuous feedback from test users and ensure alignment with the performance and security requirements (e.g. hitting the <200ms API response target and >99.9% uptime). By following this roadmap, the platform incrementally evolves from a functional MVP into a scalable commercial product.

## User Roles and Access Levels

The platform serves different **user roles**, each with specific access privileges and feature sets, managed through a role-based access control (RBAC) system:

* **Admin:** Administrators have full access to system management features. They can configure data providers (e.g. input/update Angel One API credentials), monitor the centralized feed status, view performance metrics, and manage users and subscriptions. Admins use the Admin Dashboard (available by Phase 4) to perform actions like cycling the data feed service, viewing error logs, and enforcing user limits. This role is internal and protected – only designated accounts (or an `admin` JWT claim) can access admin endpoints. For security, all such actions are audited (logged with timestamp and admin user) to an admin log.

* **Retail Trader:** This is the standard user of the platform (encompassing free and paid individual subscribers). Retail traders can access real-time option data, view detected patterns, set up alerts, and run backtests. Their exact feature access might depend on subscription tier: for example, a Free tier user might be limited to 1–2 instruments and basic patterns, whereas a Pro user gets all patterns and unlimited alerts. Regardless of tier, all retail users share the same application UI, with certain advanced options gated or marked “Pro” (grayed out if not entitled). The platform is initially optimized for retail traders by not requiring any complicated setup – they benefit from the centralized feed (no API keys needed on their part) and can use the platform out-of-the-box for market analysis.

* **Institutional User:** Intended for hedge funds, proprietary trading firms or enterprise clients, this role (and corresponding **Institutional tier**) is introduced around Phase 3–4 when the platform starts offering premium enterprise features. Institutional users may receive **API access** to the underlying data and signals (so they can programmatically pull data or integrate with their systems), higher rate limits on data requests, and enhanced portfolio or aggregation tools (e.g. viewing combined analytics for multiple trading accounts). They might also request custom integrations – the highest tier in the subscription model includes options like white-label branding and dedicated infrastructure. For example, the documentation’s Institutional plan at \$499/month offers white-label capabilities and custom integrations. Such features will be rolled out after the core platform is stable (per our roadmap, white-label support is deferred). Institutional users typically have access to all features available to retail, plus these extra capabilities. The system will enforce appropriate limits (e.g. Institutional can fetch data more frequently or handle more simultaneous alerts than a standard user).

The RBAC system ties into the subscription management component: each account is tagged with a role or plan which the middleware checks before serving an API request or WebSocket event. The commercial roadmap already defined subscription tiers (Free, Pro, VIP, Institutional) with feature limits, and our design reflects that. By clearly delineating roles, the platform can provide a tailored experience – admins keep the system running smoothly, retail traders get powerful analytics with minimal hassle, and institutional clients receive the high-end tools and integration points they need. This multi-tier, role-based approach also supports monetization and scaling the business as more features are added for premium tiers.

## Conclusion

In summary, the Options Intelligence Platform is architected to be a robust, scalable solution for real-time options market intelligence. By leveraging a modern tech stack (React, Node, MySQL) and a modular microservice-ready design, it meets the needs of both individual traders and institutional clients. Key custom features like the **Custom Scanner Builder** empower users to create their own pattern rules, and the **multi-channel alerting** ensures critical market movements reach users wherever they are (browser, email, phone). The phased roadmap ensures a disciplined build-out: starting from core data infrastructure and basic patterns, then layering on advanced analytics, user engagement features (alerts, backtests), and finally the commercial polish (scanners, reporting, scalability, security hardening) needed for a production launch.

Crucially, the design keeps **security and scalability** at the forefront. The Angel One API credentials are handled in a centralized, secure manner (stored encrypted and used server-side only), and the system is built to gracefully handle provider failures or surges in usage without compromising performance. By deferring non-essential features like a mobile-native app and white-label support, the team can focus on delivering a solid MVP and core value to users quickly, while still charting a path for those enhancements in later phases.

As development progresses into 2025, this platform is positioned to offer a **cutting-edge options intelligence service**: one that combines real-time data, expert-defined pattern logic, and machine learning potential, all delivered through an intuitive interface. With the architecture and roadmap laid out above, the team can execute in stages, validate with users, and iteratively build a product that stands on par with industry leaders, yet tailored for the unique demands of options trading in the Indian markets and beyond. The end result will be a world-class, scalable application – from a functional MVP to a comprehensive commercial platform – achieved within a structured timeline and with a clear vision of future growth.
