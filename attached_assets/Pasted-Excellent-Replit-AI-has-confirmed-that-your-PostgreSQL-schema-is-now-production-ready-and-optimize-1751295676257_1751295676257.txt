Excellent — Replit AI has confirmed that your PostgreSQL schema is now production-ready and optimized for performance, real-time streaming, and AI integration. Here’s the final verification breakdown along with action items for Phase 7: Hardening + Cleanup Automation.

⸻

✅ Final Summary: Database Schema Implementation Status

Area	Status	Notes
🧩 Composite Indexes	✅ Complete	5 indexes created and in use
🗂️ New Tables Created	✅ Complete	strategy_backtest_results, scorecard, ml_feature_vectors
🧮 Helper Functions	✅ Complete	Real-time retrieval & PCR calculator
⚡ Query Performance	✅ Optimized	Sub-millisecond queries verified
🧊 Table Partitioning	⚠️ Not Implemented	Not urgent, but needed for enterprise scaling
♻️ Cleanup Job Automation	⚠️ Partial	Function exists, but cron/job not wired
🪟 Materialized Views	❌ Missing	E.g. market_overview for frontend speed
🧠 AI-Ready Feature Store	✅ Complete	ml_feature_vectors live

🧭 NEXT ACTION: PHASE 7 – Operational Hardening

Here’s how you should proceed next. This can also be given directly to Replit AI for execution:

✅ Replit AI Prompt for Phase 7 – Database Hardening & Cleanup

Let’s complete Phase 7 of database infrastructure hardening.

Please implement the following upgrades:

---

🧊 STEP 1: Schedule Automated Cleanup

Set up a cron-based job to automatically clean real-time data older than 48 hours. Use either:

- PostgreSQL `pg_cron` extension
- Or a backend job runner (Node.js, Python, etc.)

If using pg_cron:
```sql
SELECT cron.schedule(
  'cleanup-old-realtime-data',
  '0 * * * *',
  $$ DELETE FROM realtime_data_snapshots WHERE timestamp < NOW() - INTERVAL '48 hours'; $$
);



⸻

🪟 STEP 2: Recreate Missing Materialized View

Recreate this materialized view used in dashboards:

CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW market_overview AS
SELECT
  symbol,
  MAX(timestamp) AS latest_time,
  AVG(ltp) AS avg_price,
  SUM(ce_oi + pe_oi) AS total_oi,
  AVG(pcr_ratio) AS avg_pcr
FROM daily_option_oi_snapshots
GROUP BY symbol
WITH DATA;

Add a refresh routine every 5–10 minutes:

REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW market_overview;



⸻

🧊 STEP 3: Add Table Partitioning (Optional for Scaling)

Prepare realtime_data_snapshots for future partitioning:

-- Alter to partition by timestamp (if required later)
-- Just plan; do not execute yet unless explicitly needed



⸻

🧪 STEP 4: Add Query Monitoring (Optional)

Add basic logging to capture:
	•	Query duration
	•	Index scan usage
	•	Alert if slow queries exceed 500ms

Can be backend-logged or using PostgreSQL auto_explain.

⸻

After applying this, please confirm with:
✅ Cleanup job visible in scheduler
✅ market_overview view recreated and refreshing
✅ Partition plan documented or staged

Only after these, we will move to testing framework & AI signal backtesting in Phase 8.

Would you like me to now:
- Start Phase 8 planning (AI & backtesting engine implementation)?
- Generate a `.sql` file for cron + view logic?
- Or design monitoring alerts for slow queries?

Let me know what you want next.
