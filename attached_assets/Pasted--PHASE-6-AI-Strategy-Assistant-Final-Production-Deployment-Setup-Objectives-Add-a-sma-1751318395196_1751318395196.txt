✅ PHASE 6: AI Strategy Assistant + Final Production Deployment Setup

⸻

🔧 Objectives:
	•	Add a smart AI assistant to recommend strategies based on live market conditions and user history
	•	Create personalization and feedback loops
	•	Finalize cloud production deployment architecture (once testing is complete)

⸻

🧩 Key Features to Implement:
	1.	LLM-Powered Strategy Assistant
	2.	User Personalization Layer (Behavior, History, Feedback)
	3.	Final Production Deployment Setup
	4.	Security Audits & Final Testing Checklists

⸻

1️⃣ LLM-POWERED STRATEGY ASSISTANT

🔍 What to Do:
	•	Use historical data + user profile + market snapshot → feed into LLM
	•	Get: “Suggest a strategy for NIFTY with high OI buildup and falling PCR”
	•	Return multiple suggestions with explanation, risk profile, and action tags

🧠 Replit Prompt:
Add Strategy Assistant using LLM:
- Backend:
  - Create `/api/ai/suggest-strategy`
  - Input:
    {
      symbol: "NIFTY",
      expiry: "2025-07-04",
      user_id: "abc123",
      snapshot_time: "2025-06-30T11:30"
    }
  - Load latest option chain snapshot + OI/PCR trend
  - Query OpenAI API (or local LLM via Ollama) with structured prompt:
    "Suggest 3 trading strategies for NIFTY. Market trend: Bearish. OI Rising, PCR Falling..."
  - Return: Strategy name, logic, action type (BUY CE, SELL PE), risk level

- Frontend:
  - Add `AiStrategyAssistant.tsx`
  - Button: “Get Strategy Ideas”
  - Render output with explanations in cards
✅ Expected Output:
	•	AI returns usable strategies with logic + tags
	•	Suggestions visible under “AI Insights” section

⸻

2️⃣ USER PERSONALIZATION LAYER

🔍 What to Do:
	•	Record:
	•	Strategy usage frequency
	•	Alerts triggered
	•	Instruments followed
	•	Use that to:
	•	Pre-fill AI queries
	•	Highlight saved patterns
	•	Rank most used reports

🧠 Replit Prompt:
Build personalization system:
- Create `user_preferences`, `user_sessions`, `feature_usage` tables
- Log:
  - strategy_id run count
  - instrument view history
  - report view count
- Add `/api/user/preferences` and `/ai/personal-context` endpoint
- On assistant query, include user context summary
✅ Expected Output:
	•	AI assistant gets user-specific queries
	•	Platform highlights “Your Most Used Reports” and “Recently Triggered Alerts”

⸻

3️⃣ FINAL PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT ARCHITECTURE

🔍 What to Do:
	•	Build hardened production image with:
	•	Health checks
	•	Node clustering
	•	Horizontal scaling options
	•	Choose final deployment host:
	•	🟢 Fly.io — Global CDN + Edge + Redis
	•	🟢 AWS ECS or Fargate — Full infra control
	•	🟢 Railway or Render — Easy launch + monitoring

🧠 Replit Prompt:
Build cloud-ready container:
- Docker:
  - Multi-stage build
  - Static files served from NGINX
  - API with PM2 process manager
- Add `Dockerfile.prod`, `docker-compose.prod.yml`
- Include health checks: `/api/health`, `/api/metrics`

Choose cloud platform:
- Setup Redis, PostgreSQL as managed services
- Set secrets via secret manager or env injection
- Enable HTTPS, TLS termination
✅ Expected Output:
	•	Fully cloud-hostable containers with secure configs
	•	Easy deployment to cloud via CLI or CI/CD

⸻

4️⃣ SECURITY AUDITS & FINAL TESTING

🔍 What to Do:
	•	Scan for:
	•	Open CORS
	•	SQL injection risks
	•	Missing HTTPS on API
	•	JWT validation + expiry
	•	Finalize E2E tests with:
	•	Login → Strategy → Backtest → Alert setup → AI Suggestion

🧠 Replit Prompt:
Run security audit:
- Use `npm audit fix` for dependencies
- Scan all Express endpoints:
  - Validate JWT token
  - Sanitize query params
  - Enforce rate limiting (prod config)

Finalize testing:
- Create final Cypress suite:
  - User signup → strategy creation → backtest → AI usage
- Ensure 100% critical path test pass
✅ Expected Output:
	•	Secure, protected APIs
	•	Final test suite passes all major workflows
