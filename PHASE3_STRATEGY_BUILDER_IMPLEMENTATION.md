# Phase 3: Strategy Builder MVP Implementation

## Overview
Complete implementation of the Strategy Builder backend with RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) and subscription tiering for the Options Intelligence Platform. This phase provides traders and admins with powerful tools to create, test, and manage custom trading strategies.

## Database Schema Implementation âœ…

### Core Tables Added
1. **user_strategies** - Stores custom trading strategies with JSON rules
2. **strategy_execution_logs** - Tracks strategy testing and execution history

### Schema Features
- JSON-based rule storage for flexible strategy conditions
- User ownership and access control
- Execution logging and performance tracking
- Comprehensive audit trail for strategy modifications

## Backend API Implementation âœ…

### Strategy CRUD Operations
All endpoints include authentication middleware and user authorization:

1. **GET /api/strategies** - List user's strategies
2. **GET /api/strategies/:id** - Get specific strategy details
3. **POST /api/strategies** - Create new strategy
4. **PUT /api/strategies/:id** - Update existing strategy
5. **DELETE /api/strategies/:id** - Delete strategy
6. **POST /api/strategies/:id/execute** - Test strategy against live data

### Strategy Engine Features
- Real-time market data integration
- JSON-based condition evaluation
- Pattern matching and signal detection
- Performance metrics and execution logging

### JSON Schema Structure
```json
{
  "conditions": [
    {
      "field": "openInterest",
      "operator": "greater_than",
      "value": 1000000,
      "instrument": "NIFTY"
    }
  ],
  "logic": "AND"
}
```

## Authentication & Authorization âœ…

### RBAC Implementation
- **Admins**: Full access to all strategies and system management
- **Traders**: Access to personal strategies and execution
- **Role-based middleware** protecting all API endpoints

### Security Features
- JWT-based authentication
- User ownership verification
- Session-based access control
- Comprehensive error handling

## Strategy Execution Engine âœ…

### Real-time Processing
- Live market data integration
- Multi-instrument condition checking
- Pattern detection algorithms
- Signal generation and filtering

### Execution Tracking
- Performance metrics collection
- Historical execution logs
- Success/failure analytics
- Execution time measurement

## Current Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed Features
1. Database schema with proper relations
2. Complete CRUD API with authentication
3. Strategy execution engine
4. JSON-based rule evaluation
5. Real-time market data integration
6. Execution logging and tracking
7. User authorization and RBAC
8. Error handling and validation

### ðŸŸ¡ In Progress
1. Frontend Strategy Builder UI
2. Visual rule builder interface
3. Strategy performance dashboard
4. Advanced pattern library

### ðŸ“‹ Planned Features
1. Strategy backtesting module
2. Paper trading simulation
3. Live trading integration
4. Advanced analytics dashboard
5. Strategy marketplace
6. AI-powered strategy recommendations

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow
1. **Strategy Creation**: User creates JSON-based trading rules
2. **Validation**: Backend validates rule structure and conditions
3. **Storage**: Strategy saved with user ownership and metadata
4. **Execution**: Real-time evaluation against live market data
5. **Logging**: Results stored for analysis and optimization

### Performance Optimizations
- Redis caching for frequently accessed strategies
- Database indexing for fast query performance
- WebSocket integration for real-time updates
- Efficient JSON parsing and evaluation

## API Documentation

### Create Strategy
```bash
POST /api/strategies
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "High OI Call Strategy",
  "description": "Detects high open interest in call options",
  "rulesJson": {
    "conditions": [
      {
        "field": "callOI",
        "operator": "greater_than",
        "value": 1000000,
        "instrument": "NIFTY"
      }
    ],
    "logic": "AND"
  }
}
```

### Execute Strategy
```bash
POST /api/strategies/:id/execute
Authorization: Bearer <token>

Response:
{
  "matches": [
    {
      "instrument": "NIFTY",
      "strike": 24500,
      "callOI": 1500000,
      "confidence": 0.85
    }
  ],
  "executionTime": 245,
  "timestamp": "2025-06-30T15:45:00Z"
}
```

## Frontend Integration Plan

### Strategy Builder UI Components
1. **Visual Rule Builder** - Drag-and-drop interface for creating conditions
2. **Strategy Dashboard** - Overview of user strategies and performance
3. **Execution Results** - Real-time display of strategy matches
4. **Performance Analytics** - Charts and metrics for strategy optimization

### User Experience Flow
1. User accesses Strategy Builder from main dashboard
2. Creates new strategy using visual rule builder
3. Tests strategy against live market data
4. Saves strategy for automated monitoring
5. Receives real-time alerts when conditions are met

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Implement Strategy Builder frontend components
2. Create visual rule builder interface
3. Integrate with backend API endpoints
4. Add real-time strategy execution display

### Future Enhancements
1. Advanced backtesting capabilities
2. Strategy performance comparison
3. AI-powered optimization suggestions
4. Community strategy sharing
